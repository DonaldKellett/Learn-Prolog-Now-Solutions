# Learn-Prolog-Now-Solutions

My solutions to Learn Prolog Now! (https://lpn.swi-prolog.org/) from Chapter 7 onwards

Solutions to Chapters 1-6 are considered trivial and therefore published as [gists](https://gist.github.com/DonaldKellett) instead.

You may use/modify/redistribute any and all solutions in this repo as you see fit; however, I make NO guarantee as to their correctness and will NOT be liable for any resulting losses, financial or otherwise.
