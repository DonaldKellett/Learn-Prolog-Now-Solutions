## Chapter 12 Practical Session - Final Project

The 12th and final practical session featuring a mini-project as outlined in 12.5 Practical Session of Learn Prolog Now!

### `basic/`

A basic version of the project implementing the features described up to (and including) Step 5 of the project description but not beyond.  After all, Steps 6-7 are only for those *really* into Prolog hacking :wink:

- `dcg.pl` - A module `dcg` exporting the `s/3` predicate which is essentially a parser for a definite clause grammar describing some (not too complex) English sentences
- `pp.pl` - A module `pp` exporting the `pptree/2` predicate which can pretty-print a parse tree generated by `dcg:s/3` (and in fact any other ordinary term), writing the result to an output stream specified by its first argument `OutStream`
- `test.pl` - A file containing the `test/2` predicate (as well as some helper predicates) reading sentences (in Prolog-friendly format) from an input file `InFile`, parsing them according to the DCG specified by `s/3` and writing the results (with the original sentences) to an output file `OutFile` regardless of whether the parse succeeds.
